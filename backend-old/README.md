**Project Description:** \
Our project idea is to create a budget tracking app that assists users with tracking and managing their finances. Users can manually enter purchases as well as photos of receipts in order to store and track their purchases. These receipt images will be converted into text and stored in the database. We also plan to integrate Chat GPT in order to provide users the ability to search for past purchases and receive budget recommendations. Users will also be able to update financial goals and receive recommendations for managing their budget in the future.

**Database Diagram:**

User Authentication: Stores user credentials securely. Enables quick look-up for sign-in and sign-up processes.

Dashboard: Holds the summary and graphical data for each user's financial status. Enables quick retrieval for dashboard rendering.

Purchase: Keeps records of all purchases made by the user. Used for generating summaries, graphs, and budget recommendations.

Receipt: Stores images and OCR text of scanned receipts. Enables quick retrieval for editing and viewing.

Financial Goals: Holds the financial goals set by the user along with their progress. Used for tracking and notifications.

Budget Recommendations: Stores custom budget advice for each user based on their spending habits.


Export Data: Stores the exported data in various formats. Enables quick retrieval for downloading.

Vector Databases
Semantic Search: Used for enabling natural language queries in the Chat GPT Integration feature. The Vector DB will hold the semantic embeddings of text for quick and accurate search results.
